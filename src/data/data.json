Long focal length and f/2 maximum aperture allow for fine control over depth of field, using selective focus. At the same time, wide aperture is more beneficial when shooting in low light conditions.</p><h4>Performance is fast and lightweight</h4><p>The lens adds a USM ring-type ultrasonic motor along with a rear focusing system used to deliver quick and quiet autofocus performance. Accordingly, torque helps ensure that focus is achieved accurately. In addition, full-time manual focus control enhances focus control and adjusts available time more effectively.

If your device does not support the V30 standard, this card also supports the U3 standard, which likewise guarantees minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s. Read speeds are supported up to 200 MB/s and write speeds max out at 90 MB/s. A built-in write-protect switch helps to safeguard against the accidental erasure of card data. While this card has been designed for cameras that are UHS-I / V30 / U3 compatible, it may be used in devices that do not support UHS-I / V30 / U3. However, bear in mind that this card will then default to your device's speed class and bus rating, such as UHS-I and U1, which supports minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s, or Class 10, which also supports minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s. As with most SanDisk cards, this memory card is shockproof, X-ray proof, waterproof, while also being able to withstand temperatures from -13 to 185Â°F, allowing you to take this card with you into extreme environments, such as snow, deserts, and pools.
